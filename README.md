# About Sol

Sol is a world of bright, sunlit lands and huge, grey oceans, filled with great magics, powerful relics and intelligent constructs, but is also rife with forgotten technologies. The peoples of Sol are happy and peaceful, known for their kindness and generosity, and have adopted lifestyles and cultures that are very dependent on magic and technological relics.

# Character Origins

>ðŸ”… in fantasypunk or Patchwork World, you may use community trends, professions, and groups and organisations during character creation. 
>
> For example, you can pick a tag from a community trend, another from your profession, and maybe one of your bonds comes from a faction and another from a location.

People in Sol are extremely diverse. Some look a lot like humans in our own world, others are very much like folks you'll find in different fantasy or sci-fi settings, but mostly everyone has unique looks and shapes: horns, bright-coloured skin folk with hooves for feet and a whipping tail; pointy-eared, ethereal-like humanoids with speckled eyes and otherworldly looks; small, squat nimble folk, with very long noses and sharp teeth; machine-like sentient beings sustained by magic and science, made from a variety of materials, blurring the lines between magic, tech, and the nature that intertwines with both.

# Community Trends

People in Sol are not grouped by their looks or species but they can be loosely outlined by culture, affinities, goals and relationships with each other and the world. Scholars refer to these very sophisticated and multi-layered social organisms as Community Trends

There are three major community trends among people in Sol: Wildsfolk Circles, Arcane Conclaves and Construct Communes. These are not exclusively the only ones but are the most encompassing of them all.

When you create a character choose one cultural trend from the options below. It will hardly determine what you look like, if at all, but it will inform your outlooks, personality and goals, as well as some of the skills and heritage you bring along with you.

## Wildsfolk Circles

Living in the forests, savannas, and mountains, the wildsfolk are tight-knit communities divided into tribes, clans or caravans that are loosely organized by geography. 

They are very advanced groups, that have learned to sustainably harness the produce of nature. The wildsfolk are often hunters and gatherers but many communities live through trade and craft, or non-exploitive forms of industry. 

Their communities bear strong magic connections with the earth and the spirits of their ancestors.

## Arcane Conclaves

The Arcane Conclaves keep ancient knowledge, encouraging and teaching the mastery of physical sciences.

With an extensive history of heavily relying on magic, Arcane cultures and societies have developed lifestyles that are highly dependent on it.

Most Arcanes are learned in the arts of channelling  magic, though many are inclined to use these powers in tandem with advanced machines created by lost civilizations to harness their magical energies.

## Construct Communes

Some communities grow around theier reationship with solar constructs, magical machines, contraption and dweomers designed in ancient times for a myriad of tasks.

There is a strong culture of body modifiction and the development of prosthetics, aids and implements that heavily integrate people in the communes with the very relics they study.

Their very unique combination of science, medicine and mysticism makes Construct Communes the some of thee most prolific and diverse cultures uder the Sun.

# Adventurous Professions

Sol is vast and diverse, and there are many walks one may take in life. These careers are only but a few, perhaps the most notable ones, and people who perform these activities, more often than not, come up with the stuff of legend.

## Delver

A Delver is an individual who specializes in exploring the world and discovering its secrets. Some delve for ancient relics, others for past knowledge, and still others for personal gain. Whatever their motivations, all delvers are explorers at heart. Diversified in skills and motivations, delvers come from all walks of life and are often found in large communities. There are even rumours of a few daring individuals who have ventured deeper than the limits of the known world and returned with unimaginable secrets.

## Spellsword

Spellswords are the Solari standard-issue fighters. They are adept with all types of weapons and armour but specialize in the use of magic-infused attacks. The majority of a spellsword's skills are based on using magic in tandem with their weapon skills. They are a versatile class that is adept at taking down enemies quickly to avoid extended violence and minimise harm and the loss of life.

## Mystic

Mystics are a nearly lost magic class, possessing a unique blend of mysticism and mastery of technology. They are capable of touching machinery and causing it to spring to life, or using their powers to imbue a weapon or vehicle with the essence of the earth. Despite their powers, mystics are not often trusted by most societies due to the perceived dangers of their powers. Some mystics however have begun to embrace their powers, learning to use them to the advantage of the common good.

## Wayfinder

Wayfinders are a class of wandering mages that have a natural affinity for finding, manipulating and destroying magical artefacts. These mages can sense magical energy and uncover ancient knowledge, using this to their advantage. Wayfinders usually offer their services to help keep communities safe from stray magic and dangerous relics. Sometimes wayfinders venture out on their own and bring back ancient knowledge and artefacts to put towards the benefit of the people.

## Archaeologist

Archaeologists are scholars and historians who are obsessed with ancient civilizations. They search for and unearth ancient artefacts and data. These people are tinkerers, mechanics, and inventors who have a passion for ancient technology. They can commune with ancient computers, and even rebuild them, however unreliably.

# Groups and Organisations

Sol has developed some very unique groups and organisations throughout the years, fulfilling many interesting roles. These are but the most renowned of them.

## The Moonspanners

The Moonspanners are a nomadic, caravanning tribe from the desert lands of Sol. Their leaders have a powerful bond of kinship with the relics they have carved and polished over the years. With these bonds, they can harness the power of the moon and the sun to create magical energies to power their machines and mobile homes. The Moonspanners are a very ritualistic people, who strongly believe magic and machines should be worked together as one. They have great respect for the past and present.

## Couriers

The Couriers are groups of magically inclined individuals responsible for the delivery of various messages and goods throughout the world of Sol, often in the form of artefacts or other technological wonders. Using their skills, they have carved out a small, but important, corner of the world for themselves. Their work keeps Sol vibrant and alive, and many see it as prestigious or sacred.

## Solars

The Solars are ancient Constructs who have lived for over a thousand years. The Solars are powerful magic users who believe that magic should be used for good and to benefit the entire world. The Solars were the first to discover the power of the Sun and the Moon and have used this to create massive cities that float high above the clouds on the backs of massive dragon-like techno-beasts.

## The Inventors

The Inventors, a group of magicians and inventors, have a very special relationship with the magic of Sol. They spend their days studying the ruins of the past, looking for ancient technologies, and using these relics to create new, exciting things for the people of Sol. New Things are often the cause of great celebration, and people often have parties in their honour.

# Locations

Sol is a world of diverse natural biomes, some touched by magic, others changed by ancient technologies, many both. Vast stretches of uninhabited lands where the ruins of the past are but the cradle of completely new ecosystems, dotted by civilisation and crisscrossed by gentle highways cover the continental-sized islands, while the grey oceans teem with colourful, neon-lit creatures, from the smallest shrimp to the largest whales.

Here are some interesting locales you can get to know in Sol.

## Precious Grove

The Precious Grove is a small forest is filled with trees that are so old and large that they have formed a symbiotic relationship with the nearby village. The villagers can make a living from the trees, and the local wildsfolk have even built a small city within the forest that is shared with all sorts of magical creatures. The forest is filled with magical beasts as well as a great wizard who makes his home here.

## Mirrored Wasteland

The Mirrored Wasteland is an area filled with constructs and intelligent devices that seem to be almost sentient. The area is a maze of broken and rebuilt cities and industrial facilities that have been turned into something strange and new. The Mirrored Wasteland is an area where the boundaries between organic and inorganic are becoming increasingly unclear, and it is filled with a strange energy that never stops. A place where even time itself seems to break down.

## Enchanted Basin

The Enchanted Basin is a vast plain of land in the middle of a mountain range. In the centre of the Enchanted Basin is a huge, grassy plain. In the centre of the plain is the remains of a once-great city. To the north of the city is a huge, ruined fortress, filled with territorial creatures and robotic defenders. It is a sacred place to the people who have made it their home. The city was once an important centre of knowledge and trade, but now it is just a hazardous ruin.

## The Nether Pits

The Nether Pits consists of two large, deep mines that have been reclaimed by the forces of nature. The mines are filled with ancient, abandoned technology that has, over the years, mutated into various strange forms. Some of the creatures that live in the mines are actually machine creatures, built by ancient engineers to fulfil their needs. At the centre of the mines is a large, open room, filled with machines of all kinds. Strange lights sometimes flicker in the darkness, and mysterious sounds can be heard, echoing through the machines.

## The Illusion Delves

The Illusion Devas is a powerful magical temple complex. The temple was created by a once-great wizard who sought to create a place where people could come to learn and experience the power of magic. The temple was a massive success and the wizard became a legend. Over time the temple fell into disrepair but was eventually restored to its former glory by a new wave of wizardry. The temple is once again a place of learning, but this time it is an illusion. The temple is an impenetrable fortress of magic but is actually a paradise with the secret of the magical world hidden within.

## Quarters of the Shrouded Mountain

The Quarters of the Shrouded Mountain is a large district in the mountains that is home to a large community of engineers, artificers and mages. The district is a large city that is built-in and around a large mountain. The city has a large number of magical engineers that have discovered and invented new spells and technologies for use in the district. The city is a centre of commerce and is filled with a variety of shops. The city is ruled by a district chief who is elected by the people of the district.

## Tel

Tel is an ancient city that is ruled by a well-respected ruler. The city is a place of learning and has a prestigious university that is well known for its magical studies. Tel is also known as the city of eternal springs because it has a never-ending supply of freshwater. The people of Tel are very dependent on the city's magical utilities and keep the city's power supplied by magical waterfalls and fountains.

## The Eternal City

The Eternal City is a metropolis that has been built over the years to protect the unearthed lore and discoveries from the ravages of time. The Eternal City is a place of peace and prosperity, with many beautiful gardens, parks and theatres throughout the city. The city is filled with flying machines and there are even reports of a functioning submarine being found in the depths of the city. The Eternal City is a truly magnificent place and the centre of power in the world of Sol.

## The Library

The Library is a massive technological complex that is filled with hundreds of thousands of books. The Library is a place of knowledge and discovery, filled with helpful people and great treasures. No one knows what happened to the Library's engineers, but it is said that they were powerful and intelligent people. The Library has a large number of fragmented and outdated security systems and is filled with forgotten technologies.

## The Primordial Semicircle

The Primordial Semicircle is considered the actual centre of the world. It is an area of land that is rich in magic and technology. The Primordial Semicircle acts as a central hub for the world of Sol, although it is also used as a safe haven for when the world turns upside down. The largest settlements in the world are here, and it's said that "all roads begin at the Primordial Semicircle".

## About Relics and Constructs

Since most of the knowledge around their creation is lost, refurbishing, repurposing and, with plenty of skill and a dash of luck, repaired to a functional state, often to perform funtions rather different to what those were intended.

Constructs are beings whose bodies, or maybe even minds, are made from more than flesh and bone, memories and thoughts. 

Some are living artefacts that were created by skillful mages to serve as companions, or as weapons. Some are people who became symbiotically attuned to magical contraptions or technological relics.

In fact, these are just a few of infinite possibilities. In all aspects, and despite their uncanny origins, they are much like the other peoples of the world.
